## How I explained REST to my brother

1. Roy Fielding wrote the first web servers, he then did a ton of reasearch to explain why the web works the wau it does. 

2. There are so many machines in the world.

3. It is a way to get pages from your server to the browser. HTTP is a protocol example.

4. The GET will bring you what you are requesting. if you type in a website the HTTP will do a GET on that url and display you a webpage.

5. POST is used to add or upsate something.

6. PUT is used to replace something in another system.

7. PATCH is used to do a partial update.
