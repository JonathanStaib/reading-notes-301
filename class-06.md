## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. The 6 reasons for pair programming are: 
      1. greater Effenciency
      2. Engaged collaboration
      3. Learning form fellow students
      4. Social Skills
      5. Job interview readiness
      6. Work environment readiness

2. The reasons I have felt are most beneficial are Learning from fellow students and greater effiency.

3. Pair programming works so that you have a driver and a navigator. The navigator will help research and guide the driver as the driver writes out the code. It allows to brains to look at the same problem where some might be stronger than the other and help eachother. It is very efficient.
