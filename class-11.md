1. Relational Data is good for SQL, they are table based databases.

2. Customers with ID numbers for a grocery store.

3. NoSQL are distributed, they are document based, key pairs, graph databases.

4. A JSON file like we were doing before where we created our schemas.

5. noSQL is better for hierarchial data.

6. They are both good for scalability. SQL databases are vertically scalable to store an increasing load, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable to add more servers.

1. SQL stand for structured query language but he is calling it sequel.

2. Relational databases are databases that work a certain way or under certain assumptions and supports the query language.

3. Relational databases work with a table structure.

4. Schema is the information you said or is preset that you want to allow into your database. They type of information? I am not sure how to word it but I understand it.

5. A NoSQL database is a more dynamic, non relational database.

6. It has a much more flexible schema and does not follow the strict rules of a SQL database, such as MongoDB. Have less relations going on with super fast querys going on.

7. MongoDB is named after humungous because it is known to store lots of data in a very effecient way.

8. NoSQL is more flexible than SQL because your schemas aren't set in stone.

9. NoSQL is disadvantagious if you want to update your database a lot because you will have to update all of your collections on collections.
