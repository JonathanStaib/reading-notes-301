# Class 10 Reading Notes

## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

1. A call is the way to invoke a function or execute said function. A call stack temporarily stores and manages the functions invoaction.

2. Only one call stack can happen at a time.

3. LIFO means Last In, First Out. The last function to be pushed into the stack is the first to pop out.

4. [Drawing Here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1JtqrYydbrYmbM9f7qBqE1qg7hMuZcZpbg7dqjNqKTLs/edit)

5. A stack overflow is when a function calls itself with not exit point.

## JavaScript error messages

1. A reference error is when you try to use an undefinfed variable and get undefined or not defined back in response.

2. A syntax error is when their is a mistype or mistake in your code such as a missing semicolon. Or when you ddeclare a variable and never use it.

3. A range error is when you give an object an invalid length.

4. When the type you are trying to use is incompatible. You can't access something undefined.

5. A breakpoint is a break in your code. It can set your code to only run to a specific point. Great for debugging.

6. Typing debugger will allow you to see the history of code ran up until reaching that breakpoint.
