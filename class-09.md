## Functional Programming Concepts

1. Functional Programming is a style of creating the structure and elements of a computer program.

2. Pure functions are functions taht will return the same result if given the same arguements. We know it is pure by testing it.

3. Pure functions are to encourage safe ways of programming. They make the code easier to test, you dont need to mock anything.

4. Immutability means that state can not change after it is created. If you want to you would have to create a new object with a new value.

5. Referential transparency is where there are pure functions and immutable data.
